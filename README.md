# SWT Win32 Extension

###SWT Win32 Extension extends the Eclipse library SWT.

It is a software development kit enabling you to work with native code from Java programs without using JNI. With SWT Win32 Extension, you don't need to create native libraries to call a function of the operating system API or a function from any dynamic library. You write code in the Java language only, and SWT Win32 Extension does the rest. SWT Win32 Extension provides quite a number of integration features to make your Java application look and behave like a Win32 citizen.

  * Window Decorations: making windows always-on-top, transparent, flashing on the taskbar, etc.
  * Custom Shape Window: creating non-rectangular windows using custom Regions.
  * Access to Windows Registry.
  * Shell Folders: getting paths and icons of the user folders (Favorites, My Pictures, etc)
  * Shell Links: managing the system link files.
  * System Info: gathering CPU, memory, system variables information.
  * Hooks: using system hooks and allowing to intercept some system events.
  * System Menu Manager: managing the shell system menu, user can define custom menu item.
  * Windows Session: managing system session. User can logoff, shutdown, reboot computer.
  * Ole Control: providing some ole control wrappers, such as flash.
  * __Specially, you can get a lot of functions via SWT, because SWT Win32 Extension extends SWT.__
